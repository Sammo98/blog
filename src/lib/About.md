## Personal Blog and Website

Hi traveller, my name is Sam and I'm curently a software developer at Cassini Systems in London. 

This blog originally started as a bit of a side project as I wanted to explore Yew, a Rust component-based frontend library. However, it quickly took a sharp turn in another direction, with explanations as to why found in my first couple of post about the building of this blog/website itself.

I hope the following posts provide you with at least some entertainment, and maybe even a bit of information. This is probably a good time to mention as a sort of PSA that by no means do I suggest that the code written in these posts is either the correct or idiomatic way to accomplish the tasks I set out to achieve in my posts. I prefer to think of these posts as an informal collection and internal monologue of my learnings as a software engineer. For this reason, I highly encourage anyone who happens to be reading something and spot a mistake to contact me or submit a PR to the [markdown of the blog]()!

If anyone would like to get in touch, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-rees-91a3321a3/), [GitHub](https://github.com/Sammo98), or send an email to sam.rees@gmail.com
